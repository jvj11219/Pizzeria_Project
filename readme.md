# Django Project - Pizzeria
## Start a new project called Pizzeria with an app called pizzas.
- Define a model Pizza with a field called name, which will hold name values, such as Hawaiian and Meat Lovers.
- Define a model called Topping with fields called pizza and name. 
- The pizza field should be a foreign key to Pizza, and name should be able to hold values such as pineapple, Canadian bacon, and sausage.
- Register both models with the admin site, and use the site to enter some pizza names and toppings.
## Pizzeria Home Page
- Add a creative home page to your project to replace the Django default home page.
- Add a page to the project that shows the names of available pizzas.
- Then link each pizza name to a page displaying the pizza and its pizzaâ€™s toppings (add pictures if you can!)
- Create a form that allows users to post comments on any particular pizza page.
